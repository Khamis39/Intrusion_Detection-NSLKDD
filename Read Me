This code defines a load_and_preprocess_dataset function that takes as input the path to a CSV file containing the dataset and an optional n_components parameter specifying the number of features to select. The function loads the dataset, preprocesses it by scaling the features and encoding any categorical variables, applies PCA to reduce its dimensionality, and visualizes the resulting PCA using a scatter plot. The function then selects the top n_components features based on their contribution to the first principal component and returns these selected features along with the labels.
